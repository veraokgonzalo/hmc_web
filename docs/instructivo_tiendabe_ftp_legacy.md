FTP Workflow (legacy)
info
If your store uses a legacy theme with FTP enabled, this is the workflow to use. The Fork workflow offers richer features (installation management, preview URLs, fork/clone/publish) but is available only for the Ipanema theme — which is still being rolled out and may not be available to every store yet. The fork workflow does not apply to legacy themes.

The Tiendanube/Nuvemshop CLI supports syncing theme files over FTP. All FTP commands are under the theme ftp group:

tiendanube theme ftp <command>

Setup
Configure your FTP connection:

tiendanube theme ftp setup \
  --ftp-server FTP_HOST \
  --ftp-username FTP_USER \
  --ftp-password FTP_PASSWORD \
  --store-url https://yourstore.mitiendanube.com

The CLI tests the FTP connection and saves the credentials to your .nuvem config file.

Options
Option	Description
--ftp-server <host>	Required. FTP server hostname
--ftp-username <user>	Required. FTP username
--ftp-password <pass>	Required. FTP password
--store-url <url>	Required. Your storefront URL
-y	Skip confirmation prompts
-v	Enable verbose output
tip
You can find your FTP credentials in the store admin panel. Look for the "Open FTP" option in the theme settings.

Pull
Download theme files from the FTP server:

tiendanube theme ftp pull

Options
Option	Description
-y	Skip confirmation prompts
-v	Enable verbose output
Push
Upload local theme files to the FTP server:

tiendanube theme ftp push

Incremental push (smart push)
Before uploading, the CLI compares each local file against its version on the FTP server and only uploads the ones that changed. Unchanged files are skipped — this speeds up pushes on large themes, especially over slow connections.

The CLI also syncs deletions: files that exist on the server but not in your local directory are removed from FTP during push.

To force every file to be uploaded without remote comparison, use --force:

tiendanube theme ftp push --force

Options
Option	Description
--force	Upload all files without remote comparison (skips unchanged-file detection)
-y	Skip confirmation prompts
-v	Enable verbose output
Watch
Watch local files and sync changes to FTP on save:

tiendanube theme ftp watch

Like the Theme watch mode, this monitors your local files and pushes changes automatically. It also handles file deletions. By default, it opens a browser window pointed at your storefront and reloads it after each successful sync. Use --no-browser to skip that.

Options
Option	Description
--no-browser	Don't open or reload a browser window
-v	Enable verbose output
